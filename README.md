# hw3jspasswordgenerator

## Purpose
To create an user friendly application that generates random passwords based on criteria selected by the user.

## Challenges
The starting point and getting the product to constantly work is the hardest part. Regardless if there is code given or I am creating it myself. The go is tough. 

## Motivation
So many times we are stuck using and reusing the same password for all of our personal accounts, (i.e. Brian12345, our pets name or maybe even our kids name(s) plus a few numbers). These passwords can be easily identified and our accounts accessed quickly. Once one account gets compromised access has been granted to all of our school accounts, bank accounts, among other things. As technoloy continues to advance the harder we as users need to work to cover all bases. The key to this is to create passwords that are not easily identified by using CAPITAL and lowercase letters, numbers, punctuation and symbols.
